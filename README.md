#  Monitoring System with Grafana, Prometheus, and Node Exporter

This project implements a complete, open-source monitoring and alerting system using **Grafana**, **Prometheus**, and **Node Exporter** on a Linux environment (tested on Kali Linux with Apple Silicon). It provides real-time system metrics visualization, proactive alerting, and infrastructure observability.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a lightweight, extensible, and user-friendly monitoring stack for system administrators and cybersecurity professionals. It allows users to:

- Collect and store system metrics (CPU, RAM, disk I/O, etc.)
- Visualize metrics through interactive Grafana dashboards
- Configure alerts for proactive monitoring and response
